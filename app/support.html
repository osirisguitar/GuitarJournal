<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>The quickest way to get my attention is to post an <a title="Github issues" href="https://github.com/osirisguitar/GuitarJournal/issues?state=open" target="_blank">issue to Github</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a Github account, email me at <a href="mailto:info@osirisguitar.com">info@osirisguitar.com</a>.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<p>There are a number of features I've considered for coming versions of the OG Journal. Some of them are already on <a title="Github issues" href="https://github.com/osirisguitar/GuitarJournal/issues?state=open" target="_blank">Github</a>, others are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Punch clock-style starting and stopping sessions.</li>
<li>Audio and/or video recording for sessions</li>
<li>More stats</li>
<li>Excel export of sessions to let users make pivot diagrams or other detailed analysis</li>
<li>Login and sharing on other social networks (Twitter is next).</li>
</ul>
